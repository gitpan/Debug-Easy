        Multiline output only shows the benchmark time for the first line to

        Benchmark data turned on for first line only for multiline output.

	    Corrections and additions to documentation.

        Additions to code comments

        Simplified 'debug' object and split it into two.

        Added tests to build process

0.07    July 19, 2014
        Added the ability to customize the debug level labels
        
        Fixed the warning message in the END block that was reported during testing.
        This was caused when the module is loaded, but the object never created (which
        happens in one of the tests).
        
        Additional code comments added
        
        Tweaks to the Makefile.PL build script to allow for parallel testing

0.08    July 23, 2014
        Added DEBUGWAIT experimental debug level.

0.09    July 25, 2014
        Removed the Perldocs for 'send_to_logger' and made it an
        internal class only by renaming it '_send_to_logger'.
        
        Made 'Data::Dumper::Simple' optional, and will fall back to
        just 'Data::Dumper' if it cannot find it.

0.10    November 26, 2014
        Made the LogLevel parameter case-insensitive.
        Tweaked the Makefile.PL to be more CPAN friendly.

0.11    November 26, 2014
        Data::Dumper::Simple is now a requirement.

        Some of the test files worked incorrectly in Perl versions < 5.10
        That should be fixed now.

0.12    November 27, 2014
        Modified Makefile.PL to be more platform friendly.
