	    Corrections and additions to documentation.

        Additions to code comments

        Simplified 'debug' object and split it into two.

        Added tests to build process

0.07    July 19, 2014
        Added the ability to customize the debug level labels
        
        Fixed the warning message in the END block that was reported during testing.
        This was caused when the module is loaded, but the object never created (which
        happens in one of the tests).
        
        Additional code comments added
        
        Tweaks to the Makefile.PL build script to allow for parallel testing
